    Rotates vectors in three-dimensional space using rotation vectors.

    Note
    ----
    This function interprets the rotation of the original frame to the final
    frame as either a projection, where it maps the components of vectors from
    the final frame to the original frame, or as a physical rotation,
    integrating the vectors into the original frame during the rotation
    process. Consequently, the vector components are maintained in the original
    frameâ€™s perspective both before and after the rotation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input : Tensor, shape (..., 3)
        Each vector represents a vector in three-dimensional space. The number
        of rotation vectors and number of vectors must follow standard
        broadcasting rules: either one of them equals unity or they both equal
        each other.

    rotation : Tensor, shape (..., 4)
        Rotation vectors.

    inverse : bool, optional
        If `True` the inverse of the rotation vectors are applied to the input
        vectors. Default, `False`.

    degrees : bool, optional
        If `True`, rotation vector magnitudes are assumed to be in degrees.
        Default, `False`.

    Returns
    -------
    rotated_vectors : Tensor, shape (..., 3)
        Rotated vectors.
